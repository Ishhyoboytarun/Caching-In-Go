/*
Memcache is a popular distributed memory caching system used to improve the performance and scalability of web applications. 
It allows storing and retrieving key-value pairs in memory, thereby reducing the need for accessing slower storage systems 
like databases. In Go, you can use a Memcache client library to interact with the Memcache server and take advantage of its caching capabilities.

There are several Memcache client libraries available for Go, including:

go-memcached: This is a pure Go implementation of the Memcache protocol, providing a low-level interface for interacting 
with Memcache servers. It supports multiple Memcache servers, consistent hashing, and several advanced features.

memcache: This is a popular third-party Memcache client library for Go, providing a simple and easy-to-use interface for 
interacting with Memcache servers. It supports most of the common Memcache operations, including get, set, delete, and increment.

gomemcache: This is another popular Memcache client library for Go, providing a simple and intuitive API for interacting 
with Memcache servers. It supports connection pooling, automatic retries, and other advanced features.
*/


/*
To use a Memcache client library in Go, you need to first install it using Go's package manager, go get. 
For example, to install the memcache library, you can run the following command:

go get github.com/bradfitz/gomemcache/memcache
*/

package MemCache

import (
    "github.com/bradfitz/gomemcache/memcache"
)

func main() {
    // Connect to a Memcache server
    mc := memcache.New("localhost:11211")

    // Store a value in Memcache
    err := mc.Set(&memcache.Item{Key: "mykey", Value: []byte("myvalue")})
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Retrieve a value from Memcache
    item, err := mc.Get("mykey")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    fmt.Println(string(item.Value))
}

/*
This example connects to a Memcache server running on localhost:11211, stores a key-value pair 
with key mykey and value myvalue, and then retrieves the value of mykey and prints it to the console.

Note that the above code is just a simple example to illustrate how to use the memcache library in Go. 
In a real-world application, you would typically use Memcache to cache frequently accessed data to 
improve performance and reduce the load on your backend servers.
